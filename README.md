# recipe-randomizer

## Let's you once and for all randomize your meals for whatever timeframe you can think about.

### Features planned:

- [ ] You can take pictures of your meals and add them to your recipes to remember how good they looked
- [ ] Ratings for your recipes will make it clear who's your favorite
- [ ] Create a shopping/grocery list from one or multiple recipes and send it to your favorite partner (human or app, doesn't matter)
- [ ] Add tags to your recipes like "Yummy", "Vegan only" or whatever you like
- [ ] You can also add a comfy/fuel status to your recipes to remember how good you felt after eating it
- [ ] Also pricepoints of recipes can be added
- [ ] If you want, you can also randomize recipes for a given date in the future or even for a timeframe (multiple dates)
